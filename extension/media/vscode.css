/* media/vscode.css */
/*
  This file can be a copy of the vscode.css from VS Code's extension samples
  or a minimal set of CSS variables you want to ensure are available.
  For instance: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/blob/main/webview-view-sample/media/main.css
  Often, just linking to it is enough if your extension provides it,
  but it's safer to include the necessary styles for theme variables.

  A minimal version might just redefine some key variables if you don't want to include the whole file.
  However, the webview environment usually provides these if you're using `webview.cspSource` correctly.
  The `sidebar.css` already uses `var(--vscode-...)` variables, which should work if the
  webview is set up correctly.

  If you find theme colors are not working, ensure your CSP in `_getHtmlForWebview`
  includes `style-src ${webview.cspSource} 'unsafe-inline';` (the 'unsafe-inline' is for dynamically
  added styles by VS Code itself, but try to avoid it for your own styles).
  The `font-src ${webview.cspSource};` is also important for Codicons.

/* Ensure codicon font is loaded */
@font-face {
  font-family: "codicon";
  src: url("$(root)/node_modules/@vscode/codicons/dist/codicon.ttf") format("truetype");
  /*
    IMPORTANT: The path above is a placeholder.
    You need to ensure the codicon.ttf font file is accessible to your webview.
    One way is to copy it to your 'media' folder during your build process and link it:
    src: url('./codicon.ttf') format('truetype');
    Or, if VS Code makes it available via a variable (less common for direct font files in webviews):
    src: var(--vscode-icon-font-path) format('truetype');

    For simplicity, VS Code often injects the necessary styles for codicons if the
    HTML structure <span class="codicon codicon-your-icon"></span> is used and the
    CSP allows font loading (`font-src ${webview.cspSource};`).
    The `sidebarProvider.ts` already includes `font-src ${webview.cspSource};` in the CSP.
